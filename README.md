# Wayfinder Enterprise — B2B App with Next.js and Asgardeo

## Introduction

**Wayfinder Enterprise** is a multi-tenant B2B travel management platform. Corporate travel agencies and organizations sign up to create their own isolated workspace — each workspace is an Asgardeo sub-organization under the root. Workspace admins manage their team members, define travel policies, book flights, configure enterprise SSO, and customize their portal branding.

The app demonstrates the following Asgardeo B2B IAM capabilities:

- Self-service organization onboarding (sub-organization creation)
- Role-based access control across organizations
- Organization Switch grant for server-side org token exchange
- Subscription tier upgrades with dynamic application role sharing
- Enterprise IdP federation (OIDC) per organization
- Branding customization per organization
- User and permission management across organizations
- AI agent authentication with autonomous and delegated access flows

### Organizational hierarchy

Each company that signs up through the Wayfinder Enterprise portal becomes a sub-organization under the root Asgardeo organization. Workspace admins and members are scoped to their organization.

```
Root Organization (Wayfinder Enterprise)
├── Northstar Labs          ← sub-organization
│   ├── Admin users
│   └── Member users
├── WSO2 APAC               ← sub-organization
│   ├── Admin users
│   └── Member users
└── ...
```

## Prerequisites

- An [Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/) account
- Node.js 22 or later and npm
- Git and a code editor

## Asgardeo Configuration Steps

### 1. Register the Application

1. Sign in to the [Asgardeo Console](https://console.asgardeo.io).

Make a note of the following from the created application — you will need them later:

- **Client ID** — from the **Protocol** tab

## Using the Application

### Sign Up a New Organization

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Click **Get Started** and then **Sign Up** on the landing page.
3. Fill in your name, email, password, and organization name.
4. After sign-up, the app creates a sub-organization in Asgardeo and adds the first user as a workspace admin.

### Sign In to an Existing Organization

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Click **Sign In**.
3. Enter your organization name and click **Submit**.
4. Log in with your workspace credentials.

Alternatively, navigate directly to `http://localhost:3000/?orgId=<org-id>` to pre-populate the organization selection.

### Configure Enterprise SSO for an Organization (Optional)

Organization admins can connect their own corporate identity provider (IdP) so their team members can sign in with existing credentials. The Wayfinder Enterprise app provides a UI to create the IdP, but the following additional steps must be completed in the Asgardeo Console inside the sub-organization.

#### Create the Identity Provider

The app's **Enterprise IdP** page creates the identity provider automatically when the admin provides:

- **Name** — a display name for the IdP
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — from the external IdP
- **Authorization Endpoint URL**
- **Token Endpoint URL**
- **JWKS URL**
- **Logout URL**

#### Configure the IdP in the Asgardeo Console

After the IdP is created, switch to the sub-organization in the Asgardeo Console and complete the following steps.

1. Navigate to **Connections** in the side panel and open the created IdP.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab and add the following scopes to the **Requested Scopes** field:
   - `email`
   - `profile`
   - `groups`
3. Click **Save**.
4. Go to the **Advanced** tab, enable **Account Linking**, and configure the following federated-to-local attribute mapping:
   - Federated attribute: `email`
   - Local attribute: `username`
5. Click **Save**.

#### Set Up Group-Based Role Mapping

To automatically assign Wayfinder roles to federated users based on their IdP groups:

1. Go to the **Groups** tab of the IdP and create groups that correspond to the Wayfinder roles, for example:
   - `wayfinder-admins` → maps to `WayFinder-Admin`
   - `wayfinder-members` → maps to `WayFinder-Member`
2. Navigate to **User Management → Roles** in the side panel.
3. For each role, open the **Groups** tab and assign the corresponding IdP group. When a federated user logs in, Asgardeo matches their IdP group to the role automatically.

> The IdP creation and group-to-role mapping steps can also be fully automated through the Asgardeo Management APIs to provide a seamless in-app setup experience.
